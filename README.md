# Python lab projects
Different projects for basics of cybernetics laboratories. 
Most of them are based on machine learning techniques.
1. K-means clustering technique is presented in cluster.py
2. Comparison of precission between self organizing maps(SOM) and neural network. Described in details in opisLab2.md and presented in lab2.py.
3. Fuzzy system clustering. Described in details in opisLab3.md and presented in lab3.py.
4. Adaptive neuro fuzzy interface system was used to clusterize the data. Comparison of all the techniques in included in lab4/opisLab4.md and presented in lab4/newLab4.py.
